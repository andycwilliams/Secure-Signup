# Secure-Signup

MERN app that consists of simple signup form. Uses Material UI and (potentially) SCSS for any custom styling.

Three pages:

- Landing page
- Signup page
- Successful login page

Focused on thorough account setup and security:

- Retains user information
- Ensures visitor cannot access protected data without
- Potentially add OAuth or other authentication
- Ensures both front and backend are uncompromisable
- Provides full user feedback (such as password requirements not being met)
- Treat as fully public repository (as though it's an open source project) and try to maintain full security despite that
